However, it can do much more and be extended using python, which is what we will explore in this talk. Among others, we will see the plugins system for various part of the tool and how to reuse Ansible in a script.</p>

                 <p class="li-details">An introduction to Bayesian statistics using Python. &#160;Bayesian statistics are usually presented mathematically, but many of the ideas are easier to understand computationally. &#160;People who know Python can get started quickly and use Bayesian analysis to solve real problems. &#160;This tutorial is based on material and case studies from Think Bayes (O&#8217;Reilly Media).</p>

                 <p class="li-details">Your Python program is too slow, and you need to optimize it. Where do you start? With the right tools, you can optimize your code where it counts. We&#8217;ll explore the guts of the Python profiler &#8220;Yappi&#8221; to understand its features and limitations. We&#8217;ll learn how to find the maximum performance wins with minimum effort.</p>

                 <p><strong>Mike M&#252;ller</strong></p>
                 <p class="li-details">Descriptors and metaclasses are advanced Python features. While it is
possible to write Python programs without active knowledge of them,
knowing more about them facilitates a deeper understanding of
the language. With examples, you will learn how they work and how to
write your own descriptors and metaclasses. Furthermore, you will understand
when to use and when better not to use them.</p>
