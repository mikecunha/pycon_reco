Generators: The Final Frontier This tutorial explores advanced uses of generators and coroutines for customizing various aspects of program control-flow.   The tutorial will involve looking, in detail, at a series of interesting examples which include the following:   Defining new context managers (@contextmanager decorator)   Inlining callback functions (e.g., understanding tricks underlying features such as the inlineCallbacks decorator in Twisted).   Yieldable threads (side-stepping the GIL).   Implementing simple actors (communicating tasks).   Using generators to eliminate recursion (avoiding the interpreter recursion limit).   Although the main focus of the tutorial is on generators, attendees will gain a lot of insight into the inner workings and design of the above topics and how they related to advanced libraries and frameworks.	David Beazley	Python Core (language, stdlib, etc.)	Python generators have long been useful for solving all sorts of problems involving iteration and data flow.  However, one of their more powerful uses is in customizing various aspects of program control flow.   In this tutorial, we'll look at some more exotic uses of generators such as writing context managers, inlining callback functions, eliminating recursion, implementing actors, and more.

To be useful and trustworthy, specifications and tests need to exist as executable code, not just as documents for human reading.  That realization has begun to spread to the field of documentation as well.   Doctests were possibly the first prominent Python technology to blur the boundary between documentation and executable code.   In recent years, several other technologies have arisen, including  the doctest and autorun extensions, which insert code execution results into Sphinx documents Dexy, which generates rich documents in virtually any format from templates that combine documentation and code the IPython Notebook, which combines a full Python client with rich webpage display and Markdown-based documentation  I'll explain the problems solved by executable documentation, then introduce the audience briefly to each of these types of technologies and explain what kinds of documentation each is suitable for.	Catherine Devlin	Education	Code executes.  Docs just sit there looking pretty.  Now it's time to blur that boundary!  Tools like the IPython Notebook, Sphinx, dexy, and old-fashioned doctests blend code with docs, making package docs, educational materials, and system-level docs more engaging, relevant, and trustworthy.

This tutorial is a systematic introduction to descriptors and metaclasses. It covers all relevant information with a focus on practical applications for common tasks. It is a part of the advanced training I've been delivering over the last years in open and in-house courses as well as trainings at EuroPython, PyCon PL, PyCon DE and PyCon IE. The material has been continuously refined owing to the participant feedback.	Mike Müller	Python Core (language, stdlib, etc.)	Descriptors and metaclasses are advanced Python features. While it is possible to write Python programs without active of knowledge of them, knowing how they work provides a deeper understanding about the language. Using examples, you will learn how they work and when to use as well as when better not to use them. Use cases provide working code that can serve as a base for own solutions.

Since I started doing free-lance python web-applications work, I've been getting a lot of questions from friends about how I became a full-stack python web apps developer. Some of my friends are strong front-end engineers that want to do more API level programming, others are back-end/infrastructure engineers who to know more about human computer interaction, front-end, and feature building. This talk will focus on how to build a full-stack web application and the python specific research that I have amassed over the past several years. My goal with the talk would be to give people a conceptual understanding of all the different parts of a web-application first. Giving them the big picture will help them to organize the more specific technical information that I give them as I go on.  I will then drill into the different major parts of the application and present them with the research I have collected about how they can set things up, what tools they can use, what the trade-offs are, etc. The major sections include production server configuration, local development environments, deploying, and integration with third party sites.  I will also touch on monitoring, exception handling and notification, and a few other things are not necessary for individual projects but important as you start to scale.  Next, I will talk about the application code layer and many of the python libraries and tools they can use to make it feasible for them to build a full-stack web application on their own. An example is django-supervisor, which is a pip installation that provides a very simple interface that allows engineers to use supervisor without messing with the conf files on the machine. I also plan to offer party favors in the form of starter code repositories and instructions. My goal is to make learning different parts of the python stack more accessible to people, giving them some toys to play with and a place to start. Ultimately, this can lead to more well-rounded engineers who understand how to go about researching and gaining proficiency in new parts of the stack on their own.	Kate Heddleston	Best Practices & Patterns	This is a talk about building full-stack python web applications where you manage every part of the application yourself. I will walk through how to setup a production server with your web application code, a local development environment using vagrant, and how to deploy from your local environment to production. I will also walk through python and Django libraries that will make your life easier.	Intermediate	So you want to be a full-stack developer? How to build a full-stack python web application.

Want to get started with Django beyond the polls app? Based on the first few episodes of Getting Stared With Django, this tutorial will cover handy patterns for starting Django projects and apps. Taking off We'll cover quick improvements to settings, common apps to help you get your apps off the ground faster, and other patterns that make wrangling Django easier. We'll also cover patterns for how to, and where to, separate out apps and functionality to make re-use easier later on. Airborne During all of this, we'll take a simple app from startproject to deployment on Heroku (conference network permitting). This tutorial isn't for absolute Django beginners, but so long as you've done the Polls tutorial, you shouldn't be in over your head. It'll be fast-paced, hand-on, and thorough, so bring your computer and your typing fingers!	Kenneth Love	Web Frameworks	Getting Started With Django is a well-established series of videos teaching best practices and common approaches for building web apps to people new to Django.

I will walk through the practicalities of building a simple video game from scratch, starting with presenting one approach to structuring the game code to keep it sane. I will talk about what libraries are available and then focus on the facilities present in the library used in the tutorial. I will then walk through the development of a simple game during which the attendees will code the game. Once the game is developed I will talk about potential further development that possibilities and use the remaining tutorial time to encourage and assist attendees in their efforts to do so. The game developed will cover the key game-writing skills of controlling what appears on the screen (including tile mapping and animation), loading resources, handling user input and simulating the environment within the game. There will be demonstrations and discussion of the various tools that may be used to create game assets (tile maps, sprites and sound effects.) The tutorial will also cover packaging the game for distribution both via PyPI and as a stand-alone executable.

Are you interested in doing analysis using Python but don't know where to start? Then this tutorial is for you!  You've probably heard about how great Pandas and iPython are for doing data analysis. However, you probably aren't sure where to get started. That was the exact same place I was when I first heard about how to do data analysis in Python.  It was even more challenging having only a single undergraduate class (5 years ago) in programming and only self-taught coding experience elsewhere. In this tutorial, I aim to guide the class through the process of doing data analysis, from problem formulation to coding to deriving conclusions. I will be emphasizing one underrepresented yet crucial step that typically does not get discussed in most workshops, that is the step of translating the problem into a series of computable steps using data structures that are amenable to analysis.	Eric Ma	Science	Are you interested in doing analysis but don't know where to start? This tutorial is for you. Python packages & tools (IPython, scikit-learn, NetworkX) are powerful for performing data analysis. However, little is said about formulating the questions and tying these tools together to provide a holistic view of the data. This tutorial will provide you with an introduction on how this can be done.

Machine learning can be an intimidating topic. Rather than intimidate, this should exhilarate; sure this stuff is science, but it's science you can do on your laptop. We'll discuss how machine learning is actually an accessible topic. There is an interesting set of tools you can play with; there might still be some rocket science involved, but we can treat a fair amount of the truly fancy math as a black box. We'll explore gathering a training set, turning blobs of text into usable data, training models, and the magic that is scikit-learn. We'll use this amazing amount of processing power, data, and science to separate Hacker News articles into buckets of stuff I want to read and stuff I want to pretend doesn't exist. Attendees should learn enough to start experimenting with machine learning themselves.	Ned Jackson Lovely	Science	"It's inevitable that online communities will change, and that we'll remember the community with a fondness that likely doesn't accurately reflect the former reality. We'll explore how we can take a set of articles from an online community and winnow out the stuff we feel is unworthy.

The Python Web ecosystem has always placed a strong emphasis on testing, partly thanks to a wide range of testing tools available in Python Web frameworks. Some of the most used from those tools are dummy web clients, which allow to emit mock HTTP requests directly to your codebase and to inspect the responses' contents. However, as useful as they are, these dummy clients are limited as they do not exercise the full HTTP specification and they cannot effectively reproduce actual user interactions. With the recent advent of browser automators such as Selenium, it is now possible to use sophisticated HTTP clients to execute your tests in a more comprehensive way. Indeed, this allows you to write functional tests to ensure that all layers of your web application properly fit together and that user interactions function well from end to end. Python Web developers are already becoming increasingly familiar with Selenium et al., therefore this talk will go far beyond just an introduction to those technologies. Thus, I will present advanced techniques for testing CSS, visuals and responsive designs — all using Python. I will also offer advice on how to harness functional tests within real project workflows, in particular in a continuous integration environments. Lastly, functional tests are often criticized for being too slow and too brittle. Therefore I will present various practical tips for making functional tests faster and more robust.	Julien Phalip	Testing	This talk will present multiple advanced techniques for Web functional testing.

Working with a team and delivering projects leads to structure, requirements and processes. Both back and front end development have their own set of effective tools and processes and they need to coexists in a way collaboration and deployment could be easily done. By mixing those tools and processes you can empower your team skills and make the most out of them without sacrificing robustness and predictability. Buildout is great at building application environment and replicate anytime. By using Buildout you can easily assemble, through simple configuration, all the parts needed for your project and make sure everything is coherent. Bower, as a Web package manager, will make your front-end package management a breeze while Grunt, with an increasing plugin library, will take care of all your assets and repetitive tasks. With Ansible you'll find it easy to deploy your application with the same tools and processes by avoiding to write scripts or custom code. Great benefits you'll get by using adapted tools for specific tasks, automated and mixed in a coherent way to leverage both your front and back end development and team players.

As the layer below the popular SQLAlchemy ORM, the Core portion of SQLAlchemy is often overlooked; however, it can be extremely handy when the data can not be modeled prior to access, needs to be dynamically created, or there is no other value to having a class model. Basic Usages We'll first explore the basics of setting up SQLAlchemy in your project, and how to create tables on the fly.  Once the tables are created, we'll move into performing all the common sql operations including querying with filters, groups, and joins.  SQLAlchemy Core also exposes many SQL functions such as counts, sum, and time related statements. Speaking the Database Language SQLAlchemy uses dialects to know how to speak to specific types of databases.  Many of the common database engines are supported such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle and MSSQL.  Sometimes, you need need to build a custom dialect to accomidate an unusual function.  A recent example is Amazon Redshift, which sort of speaks postgres. We'll look at an example of the custom unload statement built for SQLAlchemy. Dynamic Table Introspect and Query Building Finally, we'll cover how to introspect an existing table to build a pythonic representation we can use for SQLAlchemy Core operations.  Since some datatypes can be unknown depending on the table structure, we'll discuss how to accommodate that.  We'll wrap up with a brief look at query chaining and the use of conditional to build dynamic queries, which builds directly on top of the simple sql operations we covered earlier.	Jason Myers	Python Libraries	This talk provides a broad-based introduction to SQLAlchemy Core library. It is focused on someone new to SQLAlchemy Core, who has experience with other database technologies such as Django or SQLAlchemy ORM. We'll cover the differences between the domain-centric models of those tools compared to the schema-centric model and how we can use that to deal with common and unusual data sources.

Taba is a distributed aggregation service, currently handling over 6M events per second, with low end-to-end latency. Similar in concept to statsd, Taba can handle orders of magnitude more data, with stronger consistency guarantees. It is built atop Redis using Python with gevent and Cython. We will discuss the data model used, and how its design impacts process flows, the database schema, network usage, cacheability, etc. We will also describe the cluster architecture, which is based on many identical distributed processes, and uses master-less coordination to automatically distribute load across the cluster. Finally, we will discuss some of the interesting challenges and solutions encountered. These include:  Memory fragmentation and ‘ratcheting’ in CPython Using generators, greenlets, and queues to great effect in reducing memory usage without sacrificing performance.

Mobile platforms are becoming very important area of IT industry and part of our live, and sure if you are Python fun you'll be interested in how can you develop some cool stuff for such platforms using your favorite language. What if you want to write simple game(or even not simple) with Python or write some application with rich graphic and even 3D elements for Android/iOS? You can do it! In my talk I'll speak about tools which may help you develop cross-platform applications with using OpenGL ES(OpenGL subset for embedded systems).  Mostly my talk is about Kivy project as it's good implementation of cross-platform framework. But it's not about Kivy as a framework for creation applications with UI, it's about Kivy's way for drawing all graphical elements which is based on the using OpenGL ES and its API you may use to develop fast graphical application. Through this API it's possible to call raw OpenGL functions, to use shaders and create fantastic graphical things if you are experienced with OpenGL. As an alternative in my talk I'll say about using some other projects like Ignifuga, another Python based framework for cross-platform game development and Panda3D, which also may be used for developing 3D applications with Python for mobile platforms. And sure if you want to make full-featured game with using some complex graphical logic, I'll say how can you optimize it with using Cython and how can you port your extensions to different platforms. During this talk some simple graphical application will be demonstrated right on the mobile device. These demos includes examples of simple 2d graphical application with integrated physics, simple 2D puzzle game, demo with basic 3D figures, Rubik's cube game(see appropriate images below): Simple 2D primitives with physic simulation  Simple puzzle demo  Basic 3D figures demo  Rubik's cube game written on Python 	Niko Skrypnik	Gaming	Games, application with rich graphic for mobile platforms?

"Django is nearly nine years old, and is pretty big, both in terms of user base and in terms of code. But what makes it useful? What makes it a good choice for Web development? It's not the feature list or the number of components, it's a few very important core ideas. The first is Django's core request/response life cycle and abstractions, which offer a higher-level approach over raw WSGI (even though ultimately Django itself will speak WSGI to the Web server, and will translate between Django's own request/response classes and WSGI's more CGI-like programming model). This carries over from the base request and response objects into the actual implementation of request processing: Django views are simply Python callables which take a request and either return a response or raise an exception, allowing for easy exploratory programming with a minimum of interference from the abstractions. The second is a tendency to find balance between shipping only the minimal code necessary for Web programming (as in many lighter-weight frameorks) and trying to ship everything. Django's core component set has remained relatively constant throughout its history, and major new features and functionality are evaluated in a very conservative fashion, with the tendency in the past few years actually being toward ""un-bundling"" -- functionality which used to ship with Django itself is now in the process of being spun off into separately-distributed applications -- and providing sound default implemenations which can be easily replaced with third-party versions as needed (as in the case of the template system, and authentication framework, to take two examples). This allows Django to cover common cases while leaving room for the community to grow solutions and additional functionality on top of a solid core. Finally, the concept of the Django application, as an encapsulated unit of functionality, gives developers a major advantage in code reuse and being able to easily integrate disparate functionality to compose more complex Web sites or Web applications. Django's core components essentially function as a dependency that all application developers can assume, and Django's APIs provide a common ""language"" all applications can speak. This helps to minimize the amount of new code developers need to write, and acts as a powerful ""force multiplier"": even a lone developer has the resources of the entire Django community, and the large existing base of applications and functionality, to draw on when embarking on a new project. Taken together, these ideas make Django a powerful and useful addition to a Web developer's toolbox, and allow developers of multiple experience levels to quickly and efficiently build useful, modern Web applications."	James Bennett	Web Frameworks	Lots of talks and tutorials try to cover Django exhaustively, going over every component and feature. But not so many take a look at the bits that let Django be Django. In this talk, we'll see exactly what those bits -- some old, some new -- are, in a way that shows why it's still a solid and popular choice for web developers nearly nine years after its initial public release.

Python has a complex past with cryptography. There are half a dozen major frameworks built on at least three separate C implementations, each with their own strengths and weaknesses and in various states of maintenance.  In our development of an open source key management system for OpenStack (Barbican), our team has spent some time investigating the major options including OpenSSL, libnss, nacl and pycrypto on the C side and PyOpenSSL, Pycrypto, python-nss and m2crypto on the Python side. In our research, we noted several challenges with the current crop of libraries including audit state, support for PyPy, maintenance status, etc. In response to this, a group of Python aficionados with more time than sense have begun development of Cryptography (https://github.com/pyca/cryptography). Cryptography is a modern Python crypto library capable of  utilizing multiple C backends based on CFFI, thus enabling PyPy use. We will cover the current state of the library, it's goals and design decisions.

Installing Python code is easy. Uninstalling it, keeping it up to date, or keeping it separate from other installed Python code, is where the difficulty lies. There are a number of tools to help you with these tasks, each of which have their place: buildout, virtualenv, pip, setup.py develop, Ubuntu/Debian packages, and distributing an operating system template for a virtual machine with (for example) Vagrant. This talk steps you through a few scenarios, choosing appropriate goals for each scenario, to come to recommendations you can use immediately. If you are any of the following, you'll enjoy the talk:   An end-user looking to install the latest Python module   A one-off module author, trying to make sure people can install your creation   A professional programmer looking to make your Python web app easier for new developers to work on, be they co-workers or open source contributors.   Failures and stories are the building blocks of experience; by attending this talk, you'll be able to learn from mine rather than repeating them. We'll discuss:   How to avoid wasting time recompiling lxml and Twisted every time you want to work on a new project.   How to make dependencies optional, so your designer can have an easy time styling your app, without first having to install a C compiler for MySQLdb, or a JDK for Solr.   How your app, like the OpenHatch Django app, can go from a 1 hour dev setup process into a 5 minute one (and how we test that).   How to identify and address conflicts between apt-get and pip.  	Asheesh Laroia	Best Practices & Patterns	This talk covers the practical use of Python packaging tools. You'll see how to keep your system clean as an end user excited about installing a Python module from the web, the purpose of setup.py, how virtualenv makes life easier (and sometimes harder), what Ubuntu/Debian tools can offer, and how to make a complex app easier for new contributors to run. It is heavy on stories and recommendations.	Intermediate	Python packaging simplified, for end users, app developers, and open source contributors	Saturday	2014-04-12 16:15:00	2014-04-12 17:00:00
"""The idea of Flask is to build a good foundation for all applications. Everything else is up to you or extensions.""  -- Armin Ronacher, creator of Flask No batteries included? Make your own. Flask purposely ships with almost nothing - it's a no-batteries-included toolkit at heart. Most functionality lies in the extension ecosystem, and if you want to share your own code, you'll need to learn how to create one. We'll talk about the architecture of Flask, and go over how you can extend it to add your own functionality.  A working example: Flask-FeatureFlags  When my team moved to continuous integration, we needed a way to deploy but hide incomplete features. I wrote a small library to add feature flagging to our application. Other teams were interested so I rewrote it as a general purpose extension and open sourced it.   It's only a hundred lines of code, but it's a good introduction to how you can extend Flask including signal hooks, decorators, and new Jinja functionality. It even works with Python 3. Where do you go from here? We'll end with a sampler of Flask extensions that push the envelope to give you an idea of where you can go after the basics."	Rachel Sanders	Web Frameworks	You can create a web application with Flask in seven lines of code, and you can grow that app to thousands. How do you create reusable, shareable libraries? We'll use a simple but real extension I created (Flask-FeatureFlags) to look at the different ways you can make Flask awesome.

Note: We know this talk has limited ties to Python, although in the technical material section we will make it very Python specific. However, the nature of on-boarding an employee will always be somewhat language and tool agnostic because it involves more people problems and dynamics than technical problems. Even so, we believe that technical on-boarding is extremely important topic for the python community (and all other technical communities). Abstract Intro With the increase of code academies training new engineers there is an increase in junior engineers on the market. A lot of companies are hesitant to hire too many young engineers who need training because they lack sufficient resources to get them up to speed. This is a talk about how to make junior engineers into independent and productive members of your engineering team faster and cheaper. We will focus on python specific resources and libraries that will help you create a simple but effective on boarding program, and talk about case studies of companies that have had success using these techniques. Understanding beginners vs. experts. This part is important because in any line of teaching, coaching, or mentoring its important to understand how to get a student/employee to the next level. That means both understanding the technical subjects they need to learn, but also understanding the soft skills they need to work on such as confidence, tenacity, or communication. Understanding these goals will help get engineers up to speed faster and cheaper. Onboarding Plan: The general theme of the onboarding plan is this: “You’re not giving new engineers answers, you’re telling them where to go when they have questions.” The onboarding plan will cover 3 ways to help new engineers know where to go when they have questions and get up to speed faster: technical material, mentors, and team relationships.  Technical material. This can include reading material, documentation, and source code. In the python community, there are a lot of resources available to help give engineers a better understanding of how to use python and what the standards and best practices are. We will provide a catalog of the materials that already exist and how you can use these materials to help engineers answer questions they have without taking up the time of developers around them. Being able to navigate the wealth of information out there will additionally serve to help engineers feel more independent and confident in their own ability to solve problems. Mentors. While people in the technology community general believe mentorship is good, there’s a lot of confusion about how to choose mentors for different engineers. There are a few guidelines when choosing mentors that will help with this process. The first guideline, the last person who learned something is the best person to teach it. I.e. the best person to help a new engineer set-up their development environment is the last engineer to join the company. Rather than having an engineer who’s been at the company longer try and walk new engineers through these tasks, simply assign the person who most recently learned it since it will be freshest in their mind. Team relationships. It’s important to integrate a new engineer into the team as quickly as possible from a social standpoint. Regardless of what the company culture is, making sure that new engineers feel comfortable with their team is critical to their confidence and ability to ask questions of different people. If a new engineer feels comfortable with more people on the team, then they will feel comfortable spreading questions around to different teammates. If they feel comfortable with only one person, then there’s less of a chance that they’ll utilize the resources of the whole team. Environment. Making sure the environment encourages questions, experimentation, and failure is important. It’s not enough to simply say that you believe in those things, the environment has to actively support that behavior at all times.  Case Studies of Companies: Hearsay Social - I did onboarding at Hearsay Social for several years while the company was small. At Hearsay we had limited resources for onboarding new engineers and most people didn’t have time to take on a new person full-time. Additionally, if the new engineer was junior we needed to get them to a place where they were independent enough to work on their own as quickly as possible.  In order to get them integrated into the team as fast as possible, we had a social gathering within the first week of them joining so they could get to know their teammates and feel welcome. We would have the last engineer to join the team help the new engineer setup their development environment. This engineer also walked them through the catalog of technical resources and documentation they could reference whenever they had a question about a tool or a coding convention. New engineers were paired with a social peer mentor so they could ask questions about the team culture and other non-technical elements of the company. Finally, junior engineers would be paired with someone more experienced for their first big project. In addition to mentors, each engineer also had an engineering manager.  Eventbrite - Eventbrite has been onboarding junior engineers out of Hackbright Academy in the past year and has some new techniques they’ve learned to get engineers up to speed quickly.  You don't need to be an expert in order to help a new engineer out with something- having other relatively new engineers helping your new one get started takes load off the sr people and helps both teacher and student. Student feels like they're not SO behind, teacher learns the material they're covering even better. THis is particularly useful when setting up the dev environment; have the most recent addition to the team assist in dev env setup. Buddy system- unrelated to teaching, but bringing new eng on board culturally Code labs- a hour set aside for new eng to ask questions about code, and usually lead into topics like django's ORM An environment where it's OK to ask questions Short, medium, long term goals- explicit ones- i.e. tracing a web request in django (short term goal).

"Castle Anthrax Introduction You will learn what a ""Rogue-like"" is. We will dive into a few sample dungeons in search of the grail (to give you an idea of what various procedurally generated dungeons look like). Be brave, Sir Galahad! Data-Structures We'll start out with some terminology to frame our problem. Then we cover some basic data-structures that are commonly used when generating dungeons and discuss their trade-offs. Algorithms This is where the action happens. We will cover three broad topics in level design and dive right in: Maze Generation Good dungeons have twisting corridors and labyrinthine passages. You will learn depth-first-search and Prim's algorithm. We will discuss the differences in the results they produce and how that can affect the design of the level and gameplay. Feature Placement Mazes aren't really dungeons. A good dungeon has rooms, doors, and pits (and beacons!). We will look at a few examples of some interesting features from other games. And then we will dive into some techniques for generating your own. We'll cover Poisson Noise, cellular automata, and placement techniques such as binary space partitioning for adding unique features to your levels. Constraint Solving Not every dungeon produced by your program is going to be worth playing. Fortunately there are techniques we can employ to hint to the computer when it has produced a dud. This is an entire area of CS research but we will briefly discuss some quick hacks you can use to generate better levels. Sir Lancelot, to the Rescue! You may be tempted to write your level generator from scratch (and you should give it a try some time). However for those in need of rescuing there are libraries in Python to get you started and give you some quick results to experiment with. Conclusion and Q&A; Finally we will take a look at a demo of some of the techniques we've seen throughout the talk. And we can open up the floor to a discussion about using procedural techniques in game design, Python tricks and tips, and (hopefully) answer any questions you may have."

Loosely coupled, distributed, even driven, asynchronous - all these are terms that you will hear when you want to build  an application that is scalable and handles large amounts of work load as if nothing happened, no sweat. There are many ways of building these, but when you talk about an application distributed across servers and talking to each other, the obvious mechanism is messaging - whether you send your own message or even using simple sockets like with Twisted or if you use a full blown broker like RabbitMQ. Even if you use something like Celery, you will have to choose a messaging backend which you want to use. And this choice is the problem - how to evaluate the various options? The choice is not governed by external factors, although things like licence, cost, support etc make an impact on your final decision. The choice is primarily driven by what your application is built to do, whether it wants to handle only the functionality part and wants the underlying messaging layer to provide guarantees about message delivery and caching, querying etc. This talk will distill my experience with seeing, building and designing such messaging applications and provide a methodology that you can use.	Narahari Allamraju	Best Practices & Patterns	The objective of this session is to give the audience an idea of how they should choose a messaging layer for their application - how to evaluate their requirements against the features of the tools and make a choice.

Since 2010, the GNOME Foundation’s Outreach Program for Women has provided 130 women with an opportunity to participate in Free Software internships. In the last year, it has expanded to 23 Free Software organizations, including the Linux Kernel, Mozilla, Wikimedia, OpenStack, MediaGoblin and the Twisted Project. Many of the participating organizations use Python. The diversity of the GNOME community has changed dramatically as a result of this effort. While women comprised only 5% of GNOME contributors attending the Desktop Summit 2009, women comprised 18% of attendees at GUADEC 2013. In a December 2012 survey of newcomers who joined and stayed involved in 12 Free Software organizations, 50% of GNOME respondents were women whereas only 6% of the respondents from other organizations were women, with no other organization having more than 15%. Moreover, GNOME had 22 female respondents, which was a greater number than the 20 female respondents from all of the other organizations combined. Organizations that joined the program within the last year are seeing similar interest in participation from women. The Wikimedia Foundation had 7 women participating in its Google Summer of Code 2013, run concurrently with the Outreach Program for Women, while they have only ever had one woman participate before. Upon joining the program, the Linux Kernel had 39 applicants, 11 of whom landed 148 patches during the application process, and 7 of whom were accepted for the program. This talk will cover the history of the program, what makes it successful, how the same strategies can be used for engaging all new contributors, and what other initiatives help increase diversity in Free Software. It will serve as a great introduction to the program for project leaders and established contributors interested in encouraging participation of women, as well as for women interested in expanding their involvement in Free Software by participating in an internship program.

When it comes to passing text from one application to another,  developers will inevitably encounter (or create!) issues that are caused by the improper handling of character encoding. This talk will briefly cover the basic Unicode “facts of life”, describe the kinds of Unicode issues that commonly occur when dealing with data from multiple sources, and introduce a set of best practices and tools that can take the pain out of fixing many common Unicode encoding issues.  Our goal in giving this talk is to make developers recognize the importance of handling Unicode encoding correctly. Users should come away with a better understanding of how Unicode works in Python, a better appreciation for why it matters, and become aware of various strategies for dealing with cases where encoding issues break software.  Attendees will be able to differentiate between the kinds of Unicode problems their application design should deal with (or prevent) and those that, in the end, can only be solved by writing some Python or using a library.    We will walk through some real-world scenarios that caused us to bang our heads against the wall in frustration until we began to fully understand how Unicode works. We will cover how to avoid these problems and discovered some tools (including the python-ftfy library) which have solved some the unavoidable problems for us.

Python, like any self-respecting high-level language, automatically deallocates memory programs no longer use. In CPython the primary mechanism for this is reference counting, which C code in the interpreter implements manually. However, reference counting must be supplemented with a real GC to deal with reference cycles. In contrast to CPython's hardcoded use of reference counting, PyPy has a flexible architecture that allows for pluggable GC implementations. Its current default GC is optimized for the creation of many small, short-lived objects, a typical allocation pattern in Python. Common to both CPython and PyPy is the problem of running finalizers of objects in cycles. PyPy and very recent CPython versions have sophisticated handling of this tricky case.	Benjamin Peterson	Python Internals	This talk will explore how garbage collection is implemented in CPython and PyPy.

The Dilemma of Zero-Waste Operations All University of California campuses are required to reach an arduous zero-waste goal by the year 2020, necessarily limiting the materials destined for landfill burial to only 5% of the total waste stream.  At UC Santa Cruz, novel efforts are underway to reach this goal all the while addressing the bigger dilemma of operating a zero-waste campus; that is, to employ a robust resource recovery system which is based on a budget centered on refuse disposal, but now must deliver all components of the waste stream away from landfill deposit.  As refuse is removed from the resource stream, new methods for budgeting functions of the department are imperative in future Grounds Services operations.   In response to the shifting basis of operational execution, the Grounds Services department developed and installed a Smart Dumpster prototype to dramatically increase collection efficiency, study waste deposit patterns, and encourage overall refuse reductions.  At its essence, the Smart Dumpster is a typical dumpster that has an integrated depth sonar that is linked to a cloud computing application.  This sonar bounces real-time depth levels from the cloud to end-user applications by employing Python software.  In doing so, all activities surrounding the dumpster’s use and evacuation are presented for real-time management, record analysis, and potential innovation. Importance of Python Programming Python was seen as integral to the Smart Dumpster concept due to its excellent programming function in regard to arrays.  This function allows multiple sonar sensors to be added to the same software program in a seamless and relatively simple manner.  Further, the sonar hardware required a Python application be installed on the senor itself to operate, interact with cloud services, and ultimately, to deliver sonar readings for end-user objectives.  This talk will outline the importance of Python for sonar operation and for creating a centralized file for managing the dumpsters on campus.  Executing a Smart Dumpster Prototype As the Smart Dumpster has been operating since July 13, 2013, the programming team has focused on end-user management capability based on the data collected and stored for review.  This talk will demonstrate the most recent iteration of the Smart Dumpster Dashboard, data analysis from the sonar’s readings, and review how operational roadblocks were overcome with Smart Dumpster design.  Even in the prototype’s infancy, evidence-based proposals for innovation have emerged with the hopes to eventually roll-out the Smart Dumpster design for the entire UC Santa Cruz campus.  By the end of the presentation, attendees will appreciate the data infrastructure necessary to integrate input devices, Python programming, and a user-friendly interface software with the Smart Dumpster prototype as evidence of a successful pilot project.	Bradley  Angell	Testing	As U. of California campuses must reach Zero-Waste by 2020, a Smart Dumpster was designed to increase efficiency, study waste patterns, and improve refuse reduction.

"Why is NoSQL the current hot scalability solution First I discuss why NoSQL is easier to scale than traditional relational databases. Then I describe how NoSQL-style compromises can be done in SQL databases, often with similar or better results because of tens of years of work in making the base data engine really fast and robust on single servers. How to do the same and more using PostgreSQL Finally I show you how to set up a python and PostgreSQL based system which is easy to scale, provides ACID guarantees where they are needed most and makes compromises for scalability and availability where the latter are deemed more important. The best thing is that this kind of scalability work for both OLTP and OLAP workloads, so the learning effort is good for both of these.  Sometimes you can even have just a single large ""database"" which can take almost any type of transaction processing and analytics load. (Though it still may be a good idea to have many instances/replicas of it for robustness) Also, if you'd rather not write any SQL, you can do all the OLTP stuff in a more pythonic way using an automagically generated ORM layer inside the database, near the data. If you are really masochistic, you can use the same ORM also for map-reduce type distributed data processing, though on more complex data queries the small effort of learning SQL usually pays off big by letting the database optimizer to select the best plan for ""map"" part of map-reduce. But as I said, everything runs inside the database, near the data and thus even the ORM & map-reduce analytics work fast. A few comparative benchmarks are provided for NoSQL style workloads on popular NoSQL databases and PostgreSQL"	Hannu Krosing	Databases	"This talk will outline and demonstrate usage of PostgreSQL for data storage and processing scenarios where new common wisdom would usually turn to ""NoSQL"" databases for scalability reasons.

"Even the most non-technical people use dozens of online services each day.  Each day, both the servers running those services and the clients used to access them are being targeted and compromised by attackers.  If your login and password haven't been part of a major breach yet, it's only a matter of time. Multi-factor authentication can defend against threats that can trivially defeat simple single-factor (""just a password"") authentication.  As a result, many popular online services, including Blizzard's Battle.Net, Google, Github, and Twitter have been incorporating multi-factor authentication in the last few years. This talk is a brief overview of multi-factor authentication, including what attacks it defends against is and what common options are available. This information should be useful to both those who have the opportunity to enable multi-factor authentication on services they use and providers of services who might be wondering whether they should provide multi-factor authentication. This talk will also cover a one-time-passwords, an important concept in one form of multi-factor authentication, as well as give some general guidelines on implementing two-factor auth in some common Python web frameworks."

In many ways Python is very similar to other programming languages.  However, in a few subtle ways it is quite different, and many software developers new to Python, after their initial successes, hit a plateau and have difficulty getting past it.  Others don't hit or perceive a plateau, but still find some of Python's features a little mysterious or confusing.  This tutorial will help deconstruct some common incorrect assumptions about Python. If in your use of Python you sometimes feel like an outsider, like you're missing the inside jokes, like you have most of the puzzle pieces but they don't quite fit together yet, or like there are parts of Python you don't understand, this may be a good tutorial for you. After completing this tutorial you'll have a deeper understanding of many Python features.  Here are some of the topics we'll cover:   How objects are created and names are assigned to them   Ways to modify a namespace: assignment, import, function definition and call, and class definition and instantiation.  Much of the tutorial is structured around namespaces and ways to change them to help you understand most of the differences between variables in other languages and Python, including   why Python has neither pass-by-value nor pass-by-reference function call semantics,   and why parameters passed to a function can sometimes be changed by it and sometimes cannot.     Iterables, iterators, and the iterator protocol, including how to make class instances iterable   How to use generators to make your code easier to read and understand   Hacking classes after their definition, and creating classes without a class statement, as an exercise to better understand how they work   Bound versus unbound methods, how they're implemented, and interesting things you can do with bound methods   How and why you might want to create or use a partial function   Example use-cases of functions as first-class objects   Unpacking and packing arguments with * and ** on function call and definition  	Stuart Williams	Python Core (language, stdlib, etc.)	This tutorial is for developers who've been using Python for a while and would consider themselves at an intermediate level, but are looking for a deeper understanding of the language.  It focuses on how Python differs from other languages in subtle but important ways that are often confusing, and it demystifies a number of language features that are sometimes misunderstood.

We are following the same rules today and one major program which helped to keep it going is the summer training. Just before summer 2008, with help from Shakthi Kannan (well known FOSS developer and mentor from India), we sent a mail to the various lists announcing an online summer training over IRC. The same training is now going on for the sixth year. Every year we see an increase of interest in the students and we started getting students from other countries too. The duration the training is around 3 months on #dgplug channel in irc.freenode.net  This presentation was the primary announcement this year, opensource.com also covered the story. In 2013 around 20+ students are working on various projects (upstream and ideas from scratch), half of the students are girls and we had a very good diversity in last years too.

This talk deals with how Twisted can be combined with pretty much anything else. A common criticism of Twisted is that it wants to take over your entire ecosystem. The point of this talk is to demonstrate that that's a misconception. Specifically, the talk will demonstrate how:  Twisted can be added to many stacks with little or no change, e.g. as your WSGI server Twisted can be added to existing blocking code easily Blocking code, new or old, can be added to Twisted code Twisted plays well with other asynchronous IO frameworks:   specifically, I will talk about combining it with gevent 	Laurens Van Houtven	Python Libraries	A talk about mixing Twisted, an asynchronous IO framework for Python, with other Python code: blocking code, other asynchronous code...

PostgreSQL has a reputation as being complex and hard to manage. It is certainly a powerful, capable database able to handle situations from a developer's laptop up to petabyte-sized installations. But that does not mean that only a special priesthood can operate it; any talented developer is capable of keeping a PostgreSQL installation healthy and happy. We'll go through the tasks that encompass 90% of what you'll have to do with PostgreSQL, from installation, through basic server tuning, routine backups and maintenance tasks, basic disaster recovery, though query analysis and tuning, and tips and tricks to get maximum performance out of PostgreSQL. A special focus will be on Python-based ORMs and their proper usage, such as Django and SQL Alchemy. We'll cover special situations, such as hosting on AWS, embedded/appliance environments, and the things you should never, ever do.

In contrast to ORM tutorials which might begin with applied object-relational examples, this tutorial takes the opposite approach of building up from underlying and core components first, moving first through relational database concepts into the Python DBAPI, then describing the SQLAlchemy Core, the SQL Expression Language, and finally the ORM. In terms of learning SQLAlchemy, this is the harder road to travel, and at the end the ORM component itself will only have been roughly introduced. However, the goal is so that new users would leave with a solid grasp on what exactly SQLAlchemy is doing and how it's doing it, so that their future endeavors in continuing to learn about ORMs, SQLAlchemy or not, is informed by a rough understanding of the underlying fundmantals of interacting with a database.	mike bayer	Databases	"The goal of the tutorial is a broad-based introduction to SQLAlchemy, spanning the Core and ORM components as well as the systems that underlie them.

This presentation will give a brief overview of machine learning, the k-nearest neighbor algorithm and Scikit.  Sometimes developers need to make decisions, even when they don't have all of the required information.  Machine learning  attempts to solve this problem by using known data (a training data sample) to make predictions about the unknown.   For example, usually a user doesn't tell Amazon explicitly what type of book they want to read, but based on the user's history, and the user's demographic, Amazon is able to induce what the user might like to read.   Scikit makes use of the k-nearest neighbor algorithm and allows developers to make predictions.  Using training data one could make inferences such as what type of food, tv show, or music the user prefers. We will use machine learning, Scikit, and the k-nearest neighbor algorithm to guess which type of music a Python programmer likes to listen to. http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html	Portia Burton	Science	One of the great features of Python is its machine learning capabilities.

We'll discuss tradeoffs encountered when building systems along the way.  ""subprocess"" behind the scenes  There's a whole lot going on when you invoke another process with the functions available from the subprocess module. The Python API is simple, but it turns out that there's a whole lot going on underneath the hood when you call out to another process, and a lot of these details are important to debugging and addressing performance issues. We'll deep dive down into what's going on here and learn about the interface between userspace applications and the Linux kernel.  wrapping C library code  With C libraries, we have the option of more tightly integrating with a Python program, which offers us more performance and control than shelling out.

I work for a small company that specializes in analytics. Our business is data and the availability of that data is crucial. We were running into problems where all of our servers were not being fully utilized, while others were overloaded. I realized that distributed computing via Celery could be an answer to a number of problems. Over the past year we have integrated Celery into a number of our systems and use it for nearly everything except for presenting the analytics to the customer. The intention of this talk is to provide a how-to guide for using Celery across a number of systems, from long-running tasks to IO-intensive applications. The process of getting our systems stable and running consistently has been a learning process and so it is my hope that this talk will help other developers avoid the mistakes I made in the process.	Lewis Franklin	Best Practices & Patterns	Distributed computing is challenging. The network can be spotty. The servers can be pushed too hard. Race conditions can show up. Tasks can seem to disappear.

Bayesian statistical methods are becoming more common and more important, but there are not many resources to help beginners get started.  People who know Python can use their programming skills to get a head start. I will present simple programs that demonstrate the concepts of Bayesian statistics, and apply them to a range of example problems.  Participants will work hands-on with example code and practice on example problems. Students should have at least basic level Python and basic statistics.  If you learned about Bayes’s theorem and probability distributions at some time, that’s enough, even if you don’t remember it! Students should bring a laptop with Python 2.x and matplotlib.  You can work in any environment; you just need to be able to download a Python program and run it.

"While SQLAlchemy can be used in many ways, it's continuing API and usage evolution is geared towards an idiomatic style of application design, which may be referred to as the foundational application style.  In this style, the application is constructed in two major parts - the first, is the so-called ""foundation"" which defines patterns and conventions to be used throughout the application, such as base classes, common types and schema elements, and other patterns that may be repeated.  The goal of the foundation is to provide as many application details as possible so that they don't find themselves within model or use case logic.  The second part of the application is essentially the models and use cases themselves; this part builds upon, and indeed drives the structure and featureset of, the foundation.   The goal in this area is for models and use cases to be laid out in as declarative and non-repetitive way as possible.   This structure allows new use cases to be added very quickly and allows the overall direction and implementation mechanisms of the application to turn on a dime, with minimal impact on models and use cases as they continue to grow in scope and number. This approach is in contrast to the style proposed by many frameworks in the Python, Ruby and PHP worlds, which seeks to eliminate to as much a degree as possible the need for custom conventions, instead providing an ever broadening set of ""out-of-the-box"" conventions and helpers seeking to accommodate any possible scenario.  While this approach has the advantage of fast ramp up times and early prototyping success, as time passes and use case complexity grows, the mismatch between pre-fab convention and application can degrade quality and maintainability. SQLAlchemy is for applications that are in it for the long haul - instead of being geared towards the ecommerce application you wrote on the plane in 30 minutes, it's geared towards the ecommerce application that sold you the plane tickets. This talk will illustrate a simple Pyramid web application which highlights a variety of conventional patterns that I've been talking about for quite some time, including typing conventions using built-in and custom types, schema naming conventions using events, production of specific SQL expressions using custom SQL constructs, using helper functions and declarative mixins to produce succinct model declarations, simple session setup/teardown patterns, simple unit tests and transaction-enabled integration tests, Alembic migration configuration, and possibly other features."	mike bayer	Databases	"In this talk we'll illustrate a simple web application using SQLAlchemy, showing
off the style of development that SQLAlchemy is most geared towards, the so-called

A data structure stores information, but also optimizes some access patterns at the expense of others. You can build a Python list and set containing the same objects, but the two containers will offer different performance depending on which operations you attempt. This talk will explore how a single fundamental data type — the array-of-bytes implemented by your computer's RAM chips — is used to create all of the others, and how each data structure's implementation optimizes it for strict ordering, easy insertion and deletion, or quick access to an arbitrary element. We will explore every container in the entire Python Standard Library as well as a few from third-party packages including NumPy. A central theme will be: where are all of the linked lists and trees? How did data structures fundamental to early computer science, and to many functional data programming languages today, come to disappear in the era of dynamic languages like Python? We will look at the roles they once filled and why garbage collection, dictionaries, and easy filtering through list comprehensions have rendered these data structures obsolete for most programmers.

Long gone are the days of simple websites -- what were once simple CGI or PHP scripts are now an amalgamation of Python packages, databases, caching layers, and task queues.  The cognitive load of all these different technologies strains even the most seasoned Python developer, encouraging bad practices that may end in disaster (or downtime).  Configuration management tools allow you to treat your infrastructure as code: it can be revision-controlled, packaged, and reused.  While Python-based configuration management tools are nascent, they still lack the maturity and features provided by the Ruby-based solutions like Puppet and Chef.  Unfortunately, these tools present a steep learning curve to Python developers unfamiliar with the dark arts of server administration, virtualization, and Ruby. Puppet provides a DSL for expressing system configuration that is popular among system administrators and developers.  Puppet modules are containers for related configuration code, and are combined for the specific needs of your application.   This presentation shows the Python developer best practices when using, writing, and testing Puppet modules.  Moreover, releases from the Puppet Forge (a PyPI for modules) are recommended for managing Python, popular web servers, databases, and web frameworks.	Justin Bronn	Systems Administration	"Puppet modules provide reusable operations (""ops"") code in a manner analogous to Django apps.

Machine learning is the branch of computer science concerned with the development of algorithms to which can learn from previously-seen data in order to make predictions about future data.  It has become an important aspect of work in a variety of applications: from optimization of web searches, to financial forecasts, to studies of the nature of the Universe. This tutorial will give an hands-on experience on  some more advanced aspects of applied machine learning with the scikit-learn package.  In particular we will focus on text processing, out-of-core learning and distributed model fitting, selection and ensembling.

Twisted is an event-driven networking library.  The problem that Twisted is trying to solve is dealing with networking events in Python.  Without Twisted, software would have to interact with sockets and deal with the fact that the results of networking operations are not immediately available.   Twisted provides mechanisms so that software does not have to interpret socket operations and does not have to block while a network operation is in progress.  This means that software can operate at a conceptually higher level of networking and can operate with a high degree of concurrency. Twisted provides some basic abstractions upon which it builds ands offers many options.  The reactor is an event loop which monitors sockets and calls back into higher level Python code when events occur.   Above the socket level, Twisted makes a distinction between transports and protocols.  A transport represents a connection over which bytes are transported such as TCP connections or UNIX pipes.  A protocol represents a networking protocol such as HTTP or SMTP.  Protocols are paired with transports but by separating the concerns, Twisted makes it easy to mix and match.  Protocol factories are used to create protocols when new connections are established.  Deferreds are a mechanism to specify what should happen in the future when an event occurs. Upon these basic abstractions, Twisted has built a large library of code for a wide range of networking protocols.  Twisted provides working implementations of many things such as HTTP, SMTP, POP, IMAP, FTP, IRC, SSH, DNS servers and clients.   They can be used as the basis for further specialized applications or they can be run as standalone applications with the twistd utility.

Yelp had a problem: how to process a mountain of logs in a distributed, fault-tolerant way.  Sounds like a perfect fit for Hadoop, right?  Just one problem: we love Python and wanted to use its conciseness and power, not to mention existing libraries and business logic, to analyze our data.  So we wrote mrjob, which tries to combine the best of the Hadoop and Python worlds.  With mrjob you can easily write MapReduce jobs in native Python, which can be executed via Hadoop Streaming on in-house Hadoop clusters or services like Amazon’s Elastic MapReduce. This tutorial will start with a brief introduction to the MapReduce paradigm.  What are the trade-offs this approach provides?  By giving up global state and variables, MapReduce buys you scalability and fault tolerance. Then we will cover an example: counting user activity in a log.  We will walk through a simple mrjob program, then ask participants to tweak the code to achieve different outputs.  mrjob has the option of running locally, so setup will be simple and attendees can focus on learning the framework instead of messing with cluster configurations. Next we will explain how to use mrjob to analyze more complex data using the Yelp dataset.  We’ll introduce some data science concepts, such as user-user similarity, and show how to calculate these metrics in mrjob.  Again, participants will be asked to extend the example to improve its sophistication. Finally, we will demonstrate how to deploy mrjob to a production cluster using Amazon’s Elastic MapReduce service.  Participants will walk away with the ability to deploy an mrjob based solution in their workplace, from testing, through deployment, to monitoring.	Jim Blomo	Python Libraries	This tutorial will take participants through basic usage of mrjob by writing analytics jobs over Yelp data. mrjob lets you easily write, run, and test distributed batch jobs in Python, on top of Hadoop.

We talk a lot about the things people can do to get the most out of being a software developer. We talk about testing, design patterns, contributing to open source, and many other topics. All of these things are important, but for some of us there's an important piece of the puzzle being overlooked. It can be hard to focus on your love of coding when you are regularly battling invisible issues like insecurity, anxiety, and lack of confidence. These issues create hurdles that get in the way no matter how much you improve as a software engineer. It is important that we talk about these issues because an unwillingness to admit they're real can make it worse. It makes them feel like the adult version of the monsters under the bed. It's scary and isolating because those around you don't understand or actively deny what you're going through. It's dangerous to go alone! Let's start talking about these issues, so people have the tools and support to fight back. You may have experienced these issues first-hand and need some help.

Part 1: What's the problem? We'll start by looking at the problem that import tries to solve: allowing python code in one module access to code in another module.  I'll introduce the idea of a namespace and draw an equivalence between a namespace and a dictionary as an example of a simple lookup table. Part 2: How do we solve it? We'll examine possible ways to allow code from one module to access code in another module.  I'll suggest different strategies and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. I'll show that those design decisions were made in other languages.  For example, we could insert all the code from Module B into Module A at compile-time.  The strengths: easy for the programmer to reason about (and others). The weaknesses: namespace collision and a rigid import system that can't change at runtime (and others).  The analogy: C's #include.  There will be three of these sections, each taking about three minutes to discuss. Part 3: Home to python This section will transition from the last by proposing a solution to code-sharing that mirrors python's actual implementation of import.  We'll discuss strengths and weaknesses of the model.  I will briefly cover the steps of the import process: finding a module and returning a loader; checking in sys.modules for the module object; initializing a new module object, if needed; and executing the module's code object in the context of the new module object just created, if needed.

Predicting the future! scikit-learn is an awesome tool allowing developers with little or no machine learning knowledge to predict the future! Once you've trained your algorithm, one of the first issues you'll tackle is how to deploy it. There are many requirements to take into account when deploying your algorithm in a production environment. Message loss and scalability are two of the bigger issues you'll have to deal with. But how? I'll work through each of the design issues and build an example system for making language predictions using scikit-learn and RabbitMQ. I'll start off by training a scikit-learn model using data from Wikipedia. Next I'll show a simple web UI similar to Google Translate which I'll use to input data into the algorithm. I'll discuss the issue of message loss, and why RabbitMQ is a good fit for solving this problem. I'll write a simple AMQP worker which will wrap the scikit-learn model.

A decorator is any callable Python object that is used to modify a function, method or class definition. A decorator is passed the original object being defined and returns a modified object, which is then bound to the name in the definition. One would generally expect the result of applying a decorator to an object to be another object which is not readily distinguishable from the original. Naive implementations of decorators do not however preserve introspectability. This can result in callable objects having different names, appearing to have different signatures or not returning the original doc strings. This can cause problems for tools where you want to derive information about the original wrapped object such as debuggers, IDEs, documentation systems or performance monitoring software. The use of the functools.wraps() decorator addresses some of these issues, but relies on decorators being implemented as closures. Using a closure to implement a decorator will not always work when wrapping functions where the descriptor protocol needs to be triggered to bind a function to an instance, to create an instance method, or where the function is a special method type such as a class method or static method. A more robust decorator, and one where the decorator is able to distinguish when it is being applied to a normal function or instance method, needs to be implemented as a combination of a wrapper and a descriptor. To also be able to use this as a generic wrapper when performing monkey patching requires even more tricks. The purpose of this talk is to walk through the various problems which arise with the more common ways of implementing decorators. It will then describe how to create a more robust generic wrapper/decorator which can be used in a wider range of scenarios than typical decorators.	Graham Dumpleton	Best Practices & Patterns	Decorators are a simple concept, yet extremely powerful. Implementing decorators which will work in a range of contexts is however non trivial.

Decorators are one of the coolest constructs in Python.  Although they aren't necessary in many python scripts/applications, there are certain problems that decorators solve beautifully.  The average python programmer may have heard of decorators, may have even used them from time to time.  But many python programmers don't know how decorators work, or often even how to construct them! This session will be a fairly in-depth exploration of decorators:  how to construct them, how they work, and how to use them in your code.

The rule of thumb for people without degrees in cryptography on securing data on the Internet is “GPG for data at rest. TLS for data in motion”.  And it’s actually a very good rule everyone should follow. The only kicker though is that configuring (and using!) TLS properly is not as simple as it sounds and if you’re not diligent as a user, developer, and ops engineer, you can easily compromise your data’s security despite best effort of everyone else. This talk will be multifaceted; you will learn:  how SSL and TLS roughly work and why their state is sorry, server- and client-side duties for best possible security, what alternatives you have for using TLS in Python, things to keep in mind when configuring servers, and what perils outside your control still can trip you up.  In other words, the leitmotif is to show you the most common traps you should know about when using and deploying applications relying on TLS for transport layer security and how to avoid them.

We had to rethink the way we did APIs, the way we rendered templates, the way we thought about page load speeds. As the world of JavaScript frameworks starts to mature and more Python projects adopt them, I wanted to go through some of what we learned the hard way. The internet is vast, but it's still pretty sparse on best practices and explanations of how to work on large projects with these tools. If you're about to embark on a project with a JavaScript framework or if you've struggled setting up your own project, I'll give you some tips and signposts to light your way.	Jeff Schenck	Web Frameworks	AngularJS is a really exciting tool for building super slick single-page apps. But if you want them to play nice with a Python backend (Django, Pyramid, Flask, etc.) you're going to have to do a little bit of wrangling. These are the design patterns that worked for us.

Modern web applications are immensely complex collections of multiple interacting systems. Many new web developers don't have the time to learn all the different pieces and tools, and often their application stability and agility suffer for it. This talk will cover a few of the major groups of tools involved in running an application including databases, web servers, and configuration managers.	Noah Kantrowitz	Systems Administration	Deploying a moderately complex web application has become quite a challenge over the years. As best-practices have evolved, it has become progressively more time-consuming to keep up with what tools exist and how to use them effectively. This talk will provide an overview of the ecosystem and provide pointers for more information about individual components or problems.

Testing is essential for code quality. Tests need to be automated and regularly run to benefit from them. Frameworks such as pytest are based on many years of exercise and help you apply best practices to your tests.  Apart from integrating well with existing unittest/nose test suites, pytest offers some unique features for writing and organising your test code. In six steps we introduce main features of py.test, with a strong focus  on best-practise organisation of test fixtures and code.  We discuss  key strategies for using py.test with existing unittest/nose code bases  and how to incrementally make use of py.test mechanisms.	Holger Krekel	Testing	Many people learn testing through the JUnit/PYUnit paradigm.  Lately, py.test's new  fixture mechanisms have gained traction among many Pythonistas.

Docker is an open source tool that simplifies managing Linux containers. A container is a sandbox environment that runs a collection of processes. Containers are light-weight VMs that share the same kernel as the host OS.  Docker adds some niceties to Linux containers such as AUFS, version control, docker registry (repository), versioning etc. This talk will serve as an introduction to working with docker tools. I'll cover the basic concepts behind docker and explain the difference between a docker container and a VM. Show a demo of how easy it is to create a docker image and launch a container from it. Briefly explain the idea behind Dockerfile and show some examples.  I'll cover how networking and filesystem changes are handled in Docker. Show a demo of how to deploy a Django application in docker and explain why it's useful to do so in production.  I'll also cover some common use cases of docker in the industry such as testing, deployment, PAAS etc.	Amjith Ramanujam	Systems Administration	Docker is a tool for sandboxing entire application environments using Linux containers. Docker's feature set includes versioning, sharing etc.  They are light-weight and fast, you can recreate a deployment environment in development or push your development containers to production.

Many web programmers think they need to find web hosting before they can share their cool creations. Instead, in this talk, we show you how to let others connect straight to your computer. It's useful for briefly getting feedback on a new Flask app, and for setting up a permanent computer to serve your Internet things to the world. The Internet was created to connect all the computer networks -- it is the network between the networks. A key tenet was that every computer should be able to send messages to any other computer. That's still true today, but if you want to run your own web server at home, or let other people send email straight to your living room with no Google in the middle, there are a few things you'll need to know. The talk emphasizes visuals, to cement your knowledge, and will conclude with recommended resources on how to follow up on each of these techniques.	Karen Rustad,Asheesh Laroia	Systems Administration	Learn how to let other people connect straight to your computer, so your Python web apps, email services, or anything else can be seen by the world.

This workshop teaches you fundamental data mining techniques as applied to popular social websites by adapting example code from Mining the Social Web (2nd Edition, O'Reilly 2013) in a tutorial-style step-by-step manner that is designed specifically to accommodate attendees with very little programming or domain experience. This workshop's extensive use of IPython Notebook facilitates interactive learning with turn-key examples against a Vagrant-based virtual machine that takes care of installing all 3rd party dependencies that are needed. The barriers to entry are truly minimal, which allows maximal use of the time to be spent on interactive learning. The workshop is somewhat broadly designed and acclimates you to mining social data from Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+, and GitHub APIs in five corresponding modules with the following memorable approach for each of them:  Aspire - Set out to answer a question or test a hypothesis as part of a data science experiment Acquire - Collect and store the data that you need to answer the question or test the hypothesis Analyze - Use fundamental data mining techniques to explore and exploit the data Summarize - Present analytical findings in a compact and meaningful way  Each module consists of a brief period in which each attendee will customize the corresponding notebook for the module with their own account credentials with the remainder of the module devoted to learning what data is available from the API and exercises demonstrating analysis of the data—all from a pre-populated IPython Notebook. Time will be set aside at the end of each module for attendees to hack on the code, discuss examples, and ask any lingering questions.

Machine learning is the branch of computer science concerned with the development of algorithms to which can learn from previously-seen data in order to make predictions about future data.  It has become an important aspect of work in a variety of applications: from optimization of web searches, to financial forecasts, to studies of the nature of the Universe. This tutorial will provide a hands-on introduction to the central concepts of machine learning and the scikit-learn package.  Beginning from the broad categories of supervised and unsupervised learning problems, we will dive into the fundamental areas of classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.  In each section, we will introduce aspects of the Scikit-learn API and explore practical examples of some of the most popular and useful methods from the machine learning literature. The strength of scikit-learn lies in its clean, uniform, and well-documented interface to efficient implementations of a large number of the most important machine learning algorithms.  By the end of this tutorial, participants will have a basic practical background in machine learning and the use of scikit-learn, and will be well poised to apply these tools in many areas, whether for work, for research, for Kaggle-style competitions, or for their own pet projects.

Python is very well-suited for processing and managing geographic  data. In this talk, I'll show you why I think they are going to be  best friends forever.  First, I'll give an introduction to some of the best Python libraries  to use with your geodata, Fiona and Shapely. These libraries help you  convert geographic data between various formats and perform complex  geoprocessing tasks in just a few lines of code.  I'll also show you why treating the very popular GeoJSON format like a  Python dictionary can make it almost trivially easy to clean up and  validate your data before you put it into use. Writing scripts to take  care of these tasks can be quick and easy, helping you integrate  dataset updates into your systems efficiently and consistently, as  well as saving you from the headache of accidentally putting bad data  into your production application.  Finally, I'll discuss some examples of how you can use Python to add  custom functionality to standard GIS software packages like ArcGIS and  QGIS, and provide a number of additional resources to help get you  started.

The aim is to cover the basics of setting up a simple Django site, but using full, rigorous TDD at every step along the way.  In past conferences I've covered the same steps as the official Django tutorial.  This tutorial is new and updated, but covers similar topics, using the same structure that I'm using for my book, which is available for free for anyone looking to follow up on what the learn.  We'll learn how to set up functional tests with Selenium, how to set up Django, how to run Django unit tests, how TDD actually works in practice, the unit test / code cycle where we re-run the tests after each tiny, incremental change to the code, as well as all the basics of Django.  We'll talk about what to test, what not to test, what the point of all this testing is anyway, and I promise to make it all at least moderately entertaining. Plus it's all in Python 3! Pre-requisites! It is absolutely vital that you come with the required software pre-installed on your PC.  It's not fair on everyone else to be sitting there while we wait for you to download stuff from PyPI over the conference network.

Last year at Hearsay Social, we went through the drill of internationalizing our codebase to support customers across the globe. We used the Python gettext framework and Babel package for translation message file generation. As we continuously deployed new features, we realized that it was hard to maintain our translations at an acceptable quality bar (particularly as an enterprise product) without constant developer intervention. We often found that we were missing translations due to latency and integrating syntax errors in message files provided by the translation service. Also, as developers edited various strings in our codebase, we lost translations for them. We had to create switches in our code to ensure that new features that did not have translations available were not turned on for international customers. Code complexity galore. We’re avid users of Github and use pull requests to integrate code into production. We used githooks to trigger translation checks (Polib and Potpie) on pull requests. We also used our existing continuous test infrastructure (Jenkins) to automate integrations with our translation service. We discovered some nifty switches in the Babel translation package for generation of translation files and revisited how strings in our code were arranged to enable quick deployment with full translation coverage for our international customers.	Ruchi Varshney	Best Practices & Patterns	Is your web app ready for a global audience? Internationalizing your codebase with gettext (bit.ly/pyconi18n) might just be the simpler part of the puzzle.

"Python's debugger, PDB, is a powerful built-in tool, but its interface is less than inviting. Many programmers I've worked with use it simply, if at all: setting a break point, and then inspecting the local state, occassionally stepping a few lines in, before continuing or killing the program. PDB can do so much more. PDB allows programmers to set breakpoints on the fly, re-run programs on exit to continue debugging, and inspect and modify execution flow. And that's just for starters. By leveraging PDB's features you can fire breakpoints conditionally, display useful information when they fire, even construct simple ""watches"" on variables. PDB is included in the standard library, which means that there are additional tools that extend if further, providing ways to debug web applications and debug over a network connection. This talk will provide novice Python programmers with a basic understanding of the Python debugger. Intermediate programmers who know about PDB will come away with knowledge of how they can better leverage it when working with their programs."

Big-O notation, data structures and algorithms. These are scary topics for many self-taught programmers, but don't need to be. The underlying concepts are relatively straight forward.

RGB LEDs are not so much a new technology, but they are becoming increasingly available and affordable. Many people use a simple blinking single-color LED as their first arduino project, because making things change in the physical world in response to code is just so darn satisfying.  To get an effective animation on a strip that contains 50 lights involves sending 150 (R + G + B x 50) values at 30 frames per second, larger projects might contain thousands of these lights. Getting really interesting effects and patterns out of full color LEDs requires a degree of abstraction in the code that sends these values to the hardware. How should the design of a library intended as a creative tool be approached? Three threads of this story will be woven together in this talk: 1) What are the hardware limits and considerations of the current LED technology  voltage requirements line losses whole strip control, vs individual node/pixel control integrated ICs and dedicated controllers suppliers and sources  2) Design considerations of a library with creativity and interaction as principal design guidelines, with BirdFish used as an illustrating example  analogy: the choreographer doesn't care about the muscle fibers of the dancers hard real time vs soft real time, OS kernel limitations the perception of animations, and adaptive framerate Using envelopes and easing functions as design components for non-linear organic motions Defining a vocabulary of input types, from simple events to gestures Be agnostic about inputs and outputs  Many parallels exist between creative lighting control presented here and old-school hardware based music synthesizer design. Both involve the real-time generation of perceptually experienced output in response to both trigger (on/off) events, and modifications mid-output (think whammy bar vibrato). In both cases, there is a need for understanding some nitty gritty technical hardware details, but then abstracting these into an API or interaction set that is intuitive and supportive of user's end goals.	Preston Holmes	Other	Blinking colored lights bring out the child in all of us. Color LED lighting technology is becoming more available and affordable.

The creation of binary executables has traditionally not been well-supported in the Python ecosystem, whether because the community gravitated towards supporting open-source software patterns where release of the source code is not an issue, or because Python applications were so often deployed as services that customers accessed remotely instead of installing on their own machines. But the future has now arrived: there are not one, but two competing solutions that will compile your Python to a real executable — that carries neither your raw Python code nor easily disassemblable .pyc files inside! The talk will explore the features of Nuitka, built from the ground up to compile Python, and Cython, which is able to do exactly the same thing as a side-effect of its main purpose: to interface Python and C/C++ for scientists and engineers. How do they differ in their features and in the resulting executable? What limits does each project place on the code that you can compile and distribute, and on the third-party libraries that you will be able to use? The talk will include a background on the difference between compilation and interpretation; a look at the features of source code versus byte code versus machine language; and the performance, unexpected error messages, and lessons learned from using both Nuitka and Cython to compile executables for distribution to real customers!

Every piece of software delivers a combination of supported behavior (“what must be”) and incidental behavior (“what happens to be”). Good software differentiates between the two. Great software uses every tool and technique available to describe the two and the difference between them to ease the work of clients, authors, and maintainers. The full behavior that a software module provides can be associated with a single exact point in the space of all possible behaviors. The behavior that that module guarantees is, for software modules of any significant size or complexity, specified less than completely, and thus can be associated with a continuum of points in the space of all possible software behaviors. We define a software module’s behavioral envelope as this continuum of allowed behaviors. Acknowledging the role that documentation and type systems play in shaping and describing a module’s behavioral envelope, we focus the bulk of our talk on how software testing isn’t today being used to reason about behavioral envelopes, how it could be, and why it should be. Testing code for algorithmic correctness is a great start on the path to stable, maintainable software, but it’s only a part of the battle. We introduce the idea of defining a behavioral envelope for your software via machine-executable tests. Such tests inform good API design and sustainable test architectures. Your tests become a critic of your design, and if you delay tests it can be the smell of technical debt creeping into your codebase. We conclude by expanding our ideas to rethink the craft of software engineering itself not as assembling simpler behaviors into more complex behaviors but rather joining simpler envelopes of guaranteed behavior into more complex and more powerful envelopes of supported behavior.	Augie Fackler,Nathaniel Manista	Best Practices & Patterns	Guaranteed behavior makes software modules useful. Software guarantees are commonly incomplete with good reason: promises that are narrow and few are most easily kept across wide ranges of platforms and long times. We define the space of a module’s allowed behavior to be its “behavioral envelope” and show that thinking and speaking in terms of envelopes eases maintenance and makes APIs delightful.

In recent years the Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture has emerged as the predominant design style for web based services. In this session you will learn about RESTful web services and how they can be implemented using the Flask microframework. Why REST? Because REST is simple and lightweight. And because the most popular implementation of the REST design is no other than HTTP, the protocol that powers the World Wide Web. Clients and servers of RESTful web services implemented on top of HTTP can take advantage of the huge existing infrastructure that powers the web. In this session you will see how easy it is to implement a web service on a general purpose web framework. Why Flask? Flask is a small, easy to use, yet fully featured open source web microframework written in Python. Its code is concise and well written, you can read it all and understand it. As you will see in the demonstration part of the session, the straightforward way in which responses to web requests are written in Flask enables developers to create easy to maintain implementations of RESTful web services.

I then detail some memcached internals that are essential to know to use it properly: how memcached divides its memory in pages and slab classes, how it decides what data to evict when its memory is full, and how the memcached LRU cache behaves. Finally, we get our hands really dirty with concrete Python examples of using memcached in the wild: how to use memcached to speed up an object's JSON serialization, how we can cache large objects in memcached with either a paginated cache or a 2-phase fetch approach, what is a ""thundering herd"" and how to prevent it, and how we can write smart decorators to minimize code rewrite and avoid cache misses."

In this tutorial we will first learn how to solve, simulate, and visualize multibody dynamics problems with Python. These methods and techniques play an important role in the design of robots, vehicles, spacecraft, manufacturing machines, etc. In particular, we will highlight the derivation of realistic models of motion with SymPy Mechanics. We will walk through the derivation of the equations of motion of a multibody system (i.e. the model or the plant), simulating and visualizing the free motion of the system, and finally we will add simple feedback controllers to control the plants that we derive. We will start with some simple college level physics problems such as the pendulum and mass spring damper and close with a more complex three dimensional problem, such as the control of a robotic arm. It is best if the attendees have some background with calculus-based college level physics. They should also be familiar with the SciPy Stack, in particular IPython, SymPy, and SciPy. Our goal is that attendees will come away with the ability to model basic multibody systems, simulate and visualize the motion, and apply simple feedback controllers all in a Python framework. Attendees will be expected to have fully read the README and installed all software  before coming to the tutorial.

Automated testing by developers has been de rigeur for more than a decade now -- or has it? Unfortunately, there are still too many organizations and too many developers that do not use automated testing in a rigorous, disciplined way. It's no surprise that writing tests makes your code more correct. I'm going to focus in particular on the lowest level of automated testing, unit testing, with the aim of explaining one of its unexected benefits: unit testing improves the design of your code. Cleaner code isn't just an intellectual exercise: it's code that is easier to understand, easier to modify, easier to extend, and easier to reuse. Regular use of unit tests will not merely help you to write more correct code; it will make you a better programmer.	Greg Ward	Best Practices & Patterns	Unit testing is like public transit: everyone agrees it's a good thing for other people to do. It's easier to swallow when you see how unit testing improves not only the correctness of your code, but the design as well. I'll walk through a real-life case study where adding unit tests turned a pretty good module into an even better one: easier to understand, extend, and reuse.

There's a gaping hole in Python advocacy: K-12 educators. Teachers are the front-lines of computer science and programming education, especially in countries where attending primary and secondary school is compulsory. Worldwide, resources to teach computer science are stretched very thin. Learn what we have to offer CS teachers and how you can help in your local area. I'll cover what it takes to find and offer a useful service to a teacher (not very much!), and the kinds of issues teachers face in the classroom. Also, you'll learn about the technologies teachers are most interested in and how you can help provide resources that a teacher can use in their classroom. Also learn about how software companies typically court school districts and educators. We're ceding too much ground to deep-pocketed proprietary software and hardware companies whose goals are largely to sell software and hardware through long-term government contracts and workforce training. Our communities should engage directly with teachers to explain what it is that we do, and how it is important and different than proprietary  development. Our goal as advocates should be universal computer and programming literacy. This is basic understanding of what a computer is, what algorithms are, what code is and how computers use them. Any child can learn these things, but these concepts are still rarely taught. Free and open source software enables literacy in a fundamental way. Anyone who believes in freedom on the web, personal liberty and democracy should be concerned about proprietary software companies dominance in the production of CS curriculum and their influence on teachers. Teachers want to use free and open source software. Let's make it easier for them to do it.	Selena Deckelmann	Education	There's a gaping hole in Python advocacy: K-12 educators.

At 2013's PyCon, the kids stole the show.  The Young Coder's workshop, comprised of two 1-day workshops, helped dozens of young and aspiring programmers explore Python for the first time.  The teaching materials we used were the same on both days - the same open-ended curriculum worked with varying degrees of success for kids from 10 to 16 years old.  The students worked on Raspberry Pis (which they were allowed to keep after the class). We also sent them home with books so that they could continue learning the way so many programmers do: hacking on their own. Since then, Young Coder classes have sprung up at regional and national Python conferences, organized by local user groups around the country, and some put on by individuals who want to see kids in their communities take their first steps in programming. These classes don't quite come together on their own, but with a little bit of effort anyone can do it.  This talk aims to go into detail about how to wrangle the supplies and people you'll need to get it done, along with all the little details that will ensure a class goes smoothly.  We'll also talk about the most important part of any class - teaching the kids!  You'll learn a few strategies for keeping kids engaged and sparking their imaginations so that they get excited about learning more.	Barbara Shaurette,Katie Cunningham	Education	Since PyCon 2013, interest in the Young Coders class has intensified. Several Python conferences have run their own, and classes outside of conferences - from one-time workshops to after school clubs - have sprung up as well.

When onboarding a few new team members (all with Rails backgrounds) onto our well-established Django project, a few questions kept coming up:   How do I change the value of this variable I'm passing down to the template? Why does this particular method get called when a user visits a particular URL? How does a request get from the server into the Django process? I haven't set this variable, and yet it's showing up fine in my template - why?  After helping out answering these, it became evident that what I thought was a cleanly and obviously laid-out framework with a clear path in an out...wasn't, at least to people new to the project. With that in mind, this talk will address a few fundamental components in the pathway on which a request turns into a response. Specifically, it will discuss:  A brief history of WSGI - how we ended up with that as a standard, and what problems it's solving (and opportunities it's opening up) for us as a language. The role of middleware as a cross-cutting plugin system that hooks into the request/response cycle, but without a context. Unlike most other things, why it get runs (in different ways) on both the request- and response-sides, and what this makes it easy to do. URL dispatching from the prespective of someone who's never used routes before, and how it makes sense to separate the external and internal representations of a resource. What precisely it is that makes up a view function, and how we can have two structures - class-based views and function-based views - which look totally differernt, but work out being the same effective thing. Context processors, and their role as the middleware of templates.  In the process of that discussion, this talk will weave together all these concepts into a streamlined walk though Django's request system, and how a GET from your browser ends up returning meaningful content.	Dan Langer	Web Frameworks	"A simple ""Hello World!"" page, served via Django, passes though a surprising number of layers & components.

When many people hear of matplotlib, they think rudimentary graphs that will need to be touched up in photoshop. This tutorial aims to correct that notion by showing attendees how to generate polished data visualizations by teaching them how to exploit the functionality provided by various matplotlib libraries, such as color, ticker, cm, axes, and basemap/cartopy and modify the visualizations provided by pandas.  Using various standard exploratory data analytics graphs as examples, this tutorial will teach the user how to work with the various components that go into a matplotlib figure. The matplotlib object model will be described in detail, including a discussion on subplots, layouts, and figures. Next comes a discussion on manipulating markers, lines, and color, creating custom colormaps, and customizing labels and ticks in all sorts of ways, including changing the size, font, color,  and placement. The talk will wrap up with an introduction to plotting simple GIS data, such as points and polygons and how to customize Pandas  visualizations.

"Over the past 8 years of programing Python professionally, I've used a bunch of concurrent/parallel APIs. I've written at least three concurrent APIs myself and influenced a few others. By far the most important part of these APIs is fan-out and fan-in. But these crucial components are not very much appreciated. Most people don't even realize they're there. The goal of this talk is to make you care about fan-out and fan-in, and see how the future of Python is bright in this regard. I'll explain what fan-out and fan-in are, and why they're useful. I'll go over a bunch of examples of fan-out and fan-in, including data constructs (ORMs like SQLAlchemy, Map Reduce, real-time aggregation), mutiple threads (subprocesses, queues, and multiprocessing), and ""futuristic"" asynchronous APIs (App Engine NDB, Tulip/PEP3156). Attendees will learn the value of fan-in and fan-out in API design. They'll have a name to give something they've used many times in their concurrent programs without realizing what the magical mechanisms are called. They'll get excited about the future of Python because Tulip/PEP3156 is such a great API for concurrency."	Brett Slatkin	Best Practices & Patterns	The most important yet underappreciated parts of concurrent APIs are good constructs for fan-out (one thread spawns others) and fan-in (many threads join together).

Meet HostnameEndpoint - it takes a hostname, does a getaddrinfo lookup on it, picks the first IPv4 and IPv6 address out of the returned list, and then using a time-involving algorithm, tries connecting to both of them. It then gives you the connection that is established first, discarding the other one. All this sounds like it would take a lot of time, but here’s the interesting part: it does not. In this talk, I aim to walk you through the development of HostnameEndpoint, right from the beginning till its successful merge to the Twisted codebase. I’ll begin by talking about the use of time-related functions in Twisted, and how one can write fast and predictable tests for them. I’ll also tell you how Twisted performs multiple network operations  “in parallel” (no, not threads), and how that’s what the reactor’s job is, essentially. As we progress, I’ll discuss the design decisions involved in the development of this endpoint and the important lessons on unit testing and test-driven development I learnt. I’ll then take you through the exciting journey of writing Twisted code, illustrate how the frightening Deferreds can be tamed to do your bidding, the ample number of times I found roadblocks and how I pushed them all away to put everything together and make it work. Finally, I'll show you how it’s still not perfect and could be improved further – largely by starting over with some parts of the code.	Ashwini Oruganti	Python Libraries	Did you know that when you resolve a hostname, you can get multiple addresses back, and pick any one to connect to? Some of these addresses will connect near instantly, while others might take a long time or time out.

Celery is a distributed task queue for Python. It is different from MapReduce because instead of applying a given mapper function on a large set of data and then aggregating (reducing) the results, in Celery you define small self contained tasks and then execute them in large number across a set of worker nodes. Each task can work on just a set of arguments which will maybe later form a part of a larger solution. Celery is written in Python and is very easy to use with minimal setup required for the workers or for the process creating these tasks that are executed on the workers.  For more in depth details on Celery you can visit www.celeryproject.com. For this workshop we will be looking at  - how to setup Celery, how to use it for simple cases and how we can do some complex workflows with Celery. The assumption is that you know Python, any level of expertise, and can understand a little bit about how and why we would like to distribute task execution - never the less we will start with a brief introduction of why we would like to distribute task execution. We will be looking at Celery, using Redis as broker, and we will be looking at a Celery monitoring tool called Flower. Celery can work with any backend for passing around the tasks and task results - which broker backend we use will ideally depend on the use case and the performance requirements that we have. However for the sake of this tutorial we will use Redis because it is very simple to setup and use.

IPython started in 2001 simply as a better interactive Python shell. Over the last decade it has grown into a powerful set of interlocking tools that maximize developer productivity in Python while working interactively. Today, IPython consists of a kernel that executes the user code and provides many features for introspection and namespace manipulation, and tools to control this kernel either in-process or out-of-process thanks to a well-specified communications protocol implemented over ZeroMQ. This architecture allows the core features to be accessed via a variety of clients, each providing unique functionality tuned to a specific use case:   An interactive, terminal-based shell with capabilities beyond the default Python interactive interpreter (this is the classic application opened by the ipython command that most users are familiar with).   A graphical, Qt-based console that provides the look and feel of a terminal, but adds support for inline figures, graphical calltips, a persistent session that can survive crashes of the kernel process, and more. A user-based review of some of these features can be found here.   A web-based notebook that can execute code and also contain rich text and figures, mathematical equations and arbitrary HTML. This notebook presents a document-like view with cells where code is executed but that can be edited in-place, reordered, mixed with explanatory text and figures, etc. The notebook provides an interactive experience that combines live code and results with literate documentation and the rich media that modern browsers can display:     A high-performance, low-latency system for parallel computing that supports the control of a cluster of IPython engines communicating over ZeroMQ, with optimizations that minimize unnecessary copying of large objects (especially numpy arrays). These engines can be controlled interactively while developing and doing exploratory work, or can run in batch mode either on a local machine or in a large cluster/supercomputing environment via a batch scheduler.  In this hands-on, in-depth tutorial, we will briefly describe IPython's architecture and will then show how to use the above tools for a highly productive workflow in Python.

This talk traces JavaScript's impact on software development tools over forty years, from 1995 until 2035. Although the language is mostly dead today, it drove the largest transformation of mainstream development tools since the creation of Unix 65 years ago. We'll examine some key moments in JavaScript's history: its accidental rise to popularity; asm.js, allowing arbitrary software to run at native speed in browsers; the language ecosystem that grew up around asm.js, displacing JavaScript itself; the replacement of traditional Unix terminals, shells, and editors with new, higher-level equivalents running against the DOM; and finally, the inversion of the browser-OS relationship, still ongoing. This story is told by someone who was a fervent JavaScript detractor during its rise. It was easy to see the language's numerous and glaring shortcomings, but miss the path that it laid out.

"The cloud provides great opportunities for a variety of important computational science challenges, including reproducible science, standardized computational workflows, comparative benchmarking, and focused optimization.  It can also help be a disruptive force for the betterment of science by eliminating the need for large infrastructure investments and supporting exploratory computational science on previously challenging scales.  However, most cloud computing use in science so far has focused on relatively mundane ""pleasantly parallel"" problems.  Our lab has spent many moons addressing a large, non-parallelizable ""big data/big graph"" problem -- sequence assembly -- with a mixture of Python and C++, some fun new data structures and algorithms, and a lot of cloud computing.  Most recently we have been working on open computational ""protocols"", worfklows, and pipelines for democritizing certain kinds of sequence analysis. As part of this work we are tackling issues of standardized test data sets to support comparative benchmarking, targeted optimization, reproducible science, and computational standardization in biology.  In this talk I'll discuss our efforts to understand where our computational bottlenecks are, what kinds of optimization and parallelization efforts make sense financially, and how the cloud is enabling us to be usefully disruptive.

"How do you create a psychology experiment which is engaging and enjoyable for participants, yet also well-controlled by scientific standards? In this talk, I will present several real experiments developed by myself and my colleague Peter Battaglia which immerse participants in a rich, 3D environment. Using Python, our experiments simulate a semi-realistic world and present a level of interactivity similar to that found in popular physics-based video games such as Angry Birds. To create such ""game-like"" experiments, we use the Panda3D video game engine. Panda3D exposes the ability to capture key presses, track the mouse, display text, simulate physics, and render 3D graphics, all with the level of precision required by a well-controlled experiment. Furthermore, because Panda3D uses Python, it integrates well with powerful tools such as NumPy and SciPy. The result is that code involved in running behavioral experiments can be reused for model simulations and data analysis. During this talk, audience members will be able to collectively participate in demos of our experiments. After each demo, I will walk through the steps that were necessary to create the experiment, emphasizing both where there are differences between implementing an interactive experiment versus an actual video game, and how the experiments fit within a larger theme of Python in science."

"Working with developers on schema migrations is a perennial challenge for DBAs and developers. Devs tend to like a ""set it and forget it"" tool. Very few of those tools work well with distributed teams, continuous integration or situations which require raw SQL. This talk discusses the strategies used to move from a pure SQL and shell migration system to using SQLAlchemy and alembic for maximum DBA and developer happiness. I'll share tips for DBAs and developers in bringing schema elements into the mainstream revision control system, and making it reasonable and easy to get code review on stored procedures from the entire team. Whether you're a Python shop looking for a better migration tool, or a DBA looking to integrate better with your developer team, you'll get useful insight into the key features your next schema migration system should support.

"I. Why Async? A. First, There Was Multithreading: Traditional web servers use a thread per connection to store state. B. Trends: Contemporary web applications trend towards using web sockets and service-oriented architectures, which require very high numbers of concurrent connections. C. Limitations of Multithreading: Per-thread overhead limits the number of connections possible. We need a more efficient way to store state. II. What Is Async? A. Single-threaded: Asynchronous frameworks support high concurrency, typically with a single thread. B. Event-driven: Async frameworks use non-blocking sockets, and register for notifications on them using EPoll, Kqueue, or similar. C. State: The techniques used to store state—coroutines, callbacks, Deferreds—are more memory-efficient than threads but unfamiliar to most programmers. III. How Does Async Work? A. Frameworks: There are a number of asynchronous frameworks available for Python. The most popular are Tornado and Twisted. This year Guido has led development on an async framework for Python’s standard library, codenamed Tulip. Tulip is included in the Python 3.4 standard library as ""asyncio."" B. Finally, Some Code: Look at a chat server written in the multithreaded style with Flask, versus an async server that uses Tulip. The multithreaded code implicitly stores its per-connection state in each thread’s stack, stack pointer, and program counter. In Tulip those concepts map to generators, references to generators, and generators’ instruction pointers. C. The Tulip Event Loop: A stroll through the code for Tulip’s event loop. Tulip uses non-blocking sockets and Epoll / Kqueue to perform concurrent operations in a single thread. D. The Worst Sin: Any synchronous code in an async app blocks the event loop and makes the application crawl. When you grasp why, you’re way ahead of most programmers using Python async frameworks. IV. When Should I Use It? A. Indications: High connection counts, server-side events pushed to clients, leisure to code against a more challenging API. B. Contraindications: Reliance on synchronous third-party libraries, relaxed performance requirements."	A. Jesse Jiryu Davis	Web Frameworks	Python’s asynchronous frameworks, like Tulip, Tornado, and Twisted, are increasingly important for writing high-performance web applications. Even if you’re an experienced web programmer, you may lack a rigorous understanding of how these frameworks work and when to use them. Let’s see how Tulip's event loop works, and learn how to efficiently handle very large numbers of concurrent connections.	Intermediate	What Is Async, How Does It Work, And When Should I Use It?
